<h3>About</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am constantly learning, both in my dream field (IT) as well as in life. Currently I have been learning Linux by self-study and hands on learning, as well as contributing regularly on the <a href="https://forum.zorin.com/">Zorin Forum <img src="./ZorinImage.png" alt="zorin" width="30" height="30"/> </a> both as tech support and moderator. I have had the honor of testing an alpha/beta of the Zorin OS 16 release. I am enrolled in the <a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Justice Through Code  <img src="./columbia-long-logo.jpeg" alt="jtc" width="150" height="30"/> </a> Google Data Anaylytics Course and am attending a DevOps Mentorship.  Technology is my passion and I strive to help others understand, or at least tolerate it, if not love it the way I do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My focus has expanded to include software development and am a graduate of the [Justice Through Code](https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode) Python course through Columbia Business School and the JavaScript Mentorship through <a href="https://emergentworks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emergent Works <img src="https://emergentworks.org/static/logo--horizontal-0a8411dce1d3d5d67be050accbbc639b.png" alt="emergent works" width="150" height="30"/> </a>. This has interested me because of my love of problem solving and helping others in their use of technology. The courses have provided the fundamentals of <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Python3 </a>, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Django4 </a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTML5 </a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSS3 </a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript </a> (ES6). It has also provided the opportunity to collaborate on projects and experience a professional environment of development.</p>
